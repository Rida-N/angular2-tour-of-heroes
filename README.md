# Debug with VS Code

This repo was forked from https://github.com/johnpapa/angular2-tour-of-heroes to show how easy it is to add a launch config to debug your app with the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) VS Code extension. The only modification to the app was adding the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

After following the original instructions below, open the directory in Code and press F5 to start. This repo has two launch configs - the first will launch a new instance of Chrome, and the second will attach to an existing instance.
